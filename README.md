# Overview

This is a small codebase intended for checkout by BMS Intro to Computer Science students for their initial programming assignments. It provides a mildly configurable platform that includes simple console style input and output and a 2D html canvas with a basic drawing API.

# Students

For each assignment, adjust the data-features string in index.html as instructed and write your code in code.js. Do not change anything else unless otherwise directed.

(Actually, feel free to experiment with this code however you like. That's one of the best ways to learn. Just keep those experiments separate from your assignments.)
